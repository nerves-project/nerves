## Host Requirements

* Mac OS 10.10+
* 64-bit Linux (tested on Debian / Ubuntu / Redhat / CentOS)
* Windows 10 with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) (experimental)
* Raspberry Pi 3 (experimental)
* Elixir ~> 1.4

See [Installation Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html) for
software dependencies.

## Quick-Reference

### Generating a New Nerves Application

```bash
mix nerves.new my_app
```

### Building Firmware

```bash
export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
mix deps.get      # Fetch the dependencies
mix firmware      # Cross-compile dependencies and create a .fw file
mix firmware.burn # Burn firmware to an inserted SD card
```

**Note:** The `mix firmware.burn` target relies on the presence of `ssh-askpass`. Some
users may need to export the `SUDO_ASKPASS` environment variable to point to their askpass
binary.  On Arch Linux systems, this is in `/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-askpass`
