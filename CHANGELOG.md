# Release Notes

## Nerves v0.9.4-dev

  * Bug Fixes
    * Fix artifact archiver to use `Artifact.download_name/1` instead of 
      `Artifact.name/1`. Fixes issues with the Docker provider and
      `mix nerves.artifact`
    * Fix issue with `nerves.system.shell` not rendering properly

## Nerves v0.9.3

  * Bug Fixes
    * Artifact download_path should use download_name. This was causing a 
      mismatch between dl files from buildroot and the resolver causing it to 
      have to download them twice
    * Fixed issue with compiling certain nerves packages when calling
      `mix deps.compile`

## Nerves v0.9.2
  
  * Bug Fixes
    * Fixed issue where env var artifact path overides were being calculated
      instead of honored.

## Nerves v0.9.1
  
  * Bug Fixes 
    * Fixed issue with artifact default path containing duplicate names
    * `Nerves.Env.host_os` can be set from `$HOST_OS` for use with canadian
      cross compile
    * `Nerves.Env.host_arch` can be set from `$HOST_ARCH` for use with canadian
      cross compile
    * mkdir -p on `Artifact.base_dir` before trying to link to build path artifacts
    * raise if artifact_urls are not binaries.

## Nerves v0.9.0

* Update Notes

Starting in Nerves v0.9.0, artifacts will no longer be fetched during
`mix compile`. Artifact archives are intended to be fetched following `mix deps.get`.
To handle this, you will need to update your installed version of `nerves_bootstrap` by
calling `mix nerves.local`. After updating `nerves_bootstrap`, you should update 
your `mix.exs` file to add the new required mix aliases found there. A helper 
function is available named `Nerves.Bootstrap.add_aliases` that you can pipe your 
existing aliases to like this:

```elixir
  defp aliases(_target) do
    [
      # Add custom mix aliases here
    ]
    |> Nerves.Bootstrap.add_aliases()
  end
```

Also, update your nerves dependency to:

`{:nerves, "~> 0.9", runtime: false}`

* API Changes
  * Moved `Nerves.Package.Providers` to `Nerves.Artifact.Providers`
  * Moved `Nerves.Package.Providers.HTTP` to `Nerves.Artifact.Resolver`
  * `Nerves.Artifact.Resolver` no longer implements the 
    `Nerves.Artifact.Provider` behaviour.

* Enhancements
  * Added Mix task `nerves.artifact.get`. Use to fetch the artifact archive from an
    `artifact_url` location. Once downloaded its checksum will be checked against
    `artifact_checksum` from the `nerves_package` config in `mix.exs`. The Mix task
    `nerves.deps.get` will recursively call `nerves.artifact.get` to fetch archives.
  * Added Mix task `nerves.artifact.archive`. This task will produce the 
    artifact archive and artifact checksum file which are used when calling
    `nerves.artifact.get`.
  * Nerves packages can override the Provider in the `nerves_package` config
    in `mix.exs` using the keys `provider` and `provider_opts`. This is
    useful to force a package to build using a specific provider like 
    `Nerves.Artifact.Providers.Docker`. See the [package configuration docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/systems.html#package-configuration) 
    for more information.
  * Added `artifact_sites` to the `nerves_package` config. Artifact sites
    are helpers that are useful for cleanly specifying locations where artifacts
    can be fetched. If you are hosting your artifacts using Github relases
    you can specify it like this:
    ```elixir
    artifact_sites: [
      {:github_releases, "orginization/project"}
    ]
    ```

    You can also specify your own custom server location by using the `:prefix`
    helper by passing a url or file path:
    ```elixir
    artifact_sites: [
      {:prefix, "/path/to/artifacts"}
      {:prefix, "https://my_bucket.s3-east.amazonaws.com/artifacts"}
    ]
    ```
    Artifact sites will be tried in order until one succeffully downloads the
    artifact.
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue with `Nerves.Utils.HTTPResolver` crashing when missing the 
    `content-disposition` and `content-length` headers.
  * Run integrity check on tar files to validate they are not corrupted on 
    download.

## Nerves v0.8.3

* Bug Fixes
  * Revert plugin Nerves in new project generator until
    the fix can be made in distillery.
    This issue was causing the release to contain compiled
    libraries from the host instead of the target.
    The error would look similar to this
    ```
    Got:
    ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1

    If binary, expecting:
    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.3, for GNU/Linux 4.1.39
    ```
    You can fix this by updating and regenerating the new project.

## Nerves v0.8.1

    ```
    Plugin failed: no function clause matching in IO.chardata_to_string/1
    ```

## Nerves v0.7.5

* Enhancements
  * Docker
    * Reduced the image size by optimizing docker file.
    * Images are pulled from Docker Hub instead of building locally.
    * Containers are transient and build files are stored in docker volumes.
    * NERVES_BR_DL_DIR is mounted as a host volume instead of a docker volume.

* Bug Fixes
  * Docker
    * Fixed issue where moving the project location on the host would require
      the container to be force deleted.

## Nerves v0.7.4

* Bug Fixes
  * Make sure the path NERVES_DL_DIR exists before writing artifacts to it.

## Nerves v0.7.3

* Enhancements

## Nerves v0.7.2

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue where `nerves.system.shell` would hang and load improperly.
* Enhancements
  * Deprecated the `rootfs_additions` configuration option, to be superseded by
    the `rootfs_overlay` option, which matches the convention used by the
    Buildroot community.

## Nerves v0.7.1

* Bug Fixes
  * The `nerves.system.shell` Mix task should not do `make clean` by default.
* Enhancements
  * The "Customizing Your Own Nerves System" documentation has been updated to
    include the `mix nerves.system.shell` functionality, including a blurb to
    recommend running a clean build any time it's not working as expected.

## Nerves 0.7.0

* Bug Fixes
  * Try to include the parent project when loading Nerves packages
  * Better error message from the Docker provider when Docker is not installed
  * Delete system artifact directories only when instructed by `mix nerves.clean` on Linux.
    This prevents triggering a full rebuild for every change made to a custom system.
* Enhancements
  * Added support for the new `nerves.system.shell` task, provided by
    `nerves_bootstrap`, to `Nerves.Package.Providers.Docker` and
    `Nerves.Package.Providers.Local`, which provides a consistent way to
    configure a Buildroot-based Nerves system on both OSX and Linux. This
    replaces the `nerves.shell` Mix task, which had not been fully implemented.
  * `mix firmware.burn` no longer asks for your password if using Linux and have
     read/write permissions on the SD card device.
