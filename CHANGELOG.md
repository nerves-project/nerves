# Changelog

## v1.5.1

* Bug fixes
  * Update compiler check on `mix firmware` to use the system OTP version
    when recommending an Elixir install.
  * Check if using Distillery when calling `mix nerves.release.init`.
    This is no longer required for Elixir 1.9+ releases.

## v1.5.0

**Updating to Nerves v1.5.0 requires modifications to your project**
See the [project update guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/updating-projects.html#updating-from-v1-4-to-v1-5) to learn how to migrate your project.

* Enhancements
  * Added support for Elixir 1.9+ releases.

* Bug fixes
  * Do not include empty priv directories when constructing rootfs
    priorities.

## v1.4.5

* Enhancements
  * Updated docs.

* Bug fixes
  * Updated the requirement for `distillery` to `~> 2.0.12`. This fixes an issue
    where `nerves` would downgrade to `1.4.0` when updating `shoehorn`.
  * Empty `priv` directories are not added to the squashfs sort ordering list.

## v1.4.4

* Bug fixes
  * This improves the path fix in v1.4.3 (see
    https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/issues/389) to cover the local
    build runner as well.

## v1.4.3

* Bug fixes
  * Raise an exception if the artifact cache fails to create a directory
  * Fixes `ArgumentError` when using OTP >= 21.3.0 and calling `mix nerves.system.shell`
  * Fixes issue with `mix nerves.system.shell` using `asdf` >= 0.7.0 where the
    path would contain `::` and Buildroot would raise the error:

    ```text
    You seem to have the current working directory in your
    PATH environment variable. This doesn't work.
    support/dependencies/dependencies.mk:21: recipe for target 'dependencies' failed
    ```

## v1.4.2

* Improvements
  * Generate rootfs.priorities file. This is used internally when constructing
    the squashfs filesystem to arrange the contents in the order the files are
    loaded at runtime which improves boot performance.

## v1.4.1

* Improvements
  * Improve error message when artifacts can't be found

## v1.4.0

Version v1.4.0 adds support for Elixir 1.8's new built-in support for mix
targets. In Nerves, the `MIX_TARGET` was used to select the appropriate set of
dependencies for a device. This lets you switch between building for different
boards and your host. Elixir 1.8 pulls this support into `mix` and lets you
annotate dependencies for which targets they should be used.

See the [project update guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/updating-projects.html#updating-from-v1-3-x-to-v1-4-x) to learn how to migrate your project.

## v1.3.4

* Bug fixes
  * Fixed issue where specifying `build_runner_opts` without `build_runner`
    would prevent `build_runner_opts` from being set.
  * Allow `http_opts` to be merged in from the artifact site opts. This fixes
    an issue with downloading artifacts from github enterprise by specifying
    `[autoredirect: true]` in the artifact site opts.

## v1.3.3

* Bug fixes
  * Lock dependency on distillery to `2.0.10` to work around:
    https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery/issues/585

## v1.3.2

* Bug fixes
  * Improved handling for burning firmware with Windows Subsystem for Linux.
  * `mix nerves.deps.get` will raise if a download was incomplete or corrupt
    after trying all resolvers.
  * `mix firmware.burn` will call `mix firmware` to ensure the firmware is the
    latest.
  * `mix burn` was added to allow for burning the latest built firmware without
    calling `mix firmware`.

## v1.3.1

* Bug fixes
  * Fix `fwup` invocations for NixOS users
  * Add `--verbose` option on `mix firmware` to help debug OTP release
    generation
  * Force users to run Elixir 1.7.3 or later if using Elixir 1.7. This avoids
    a known issue in Elixir 1.7.2 and Distillery 2.0.
  * Remove unused cookies in default `rel/config.exs` files

## v1.3.0

This version adds support for Elixir ~> 1.7 which requires updates to your
Mix project.

**Modify the release config**

It is required to modify the `rel/config.exs` file.

Change this:

```elixir
release :my_app do
  set version: current_version(:my_app)
  plugin Shoehorn
  if System.get_env("NERVES_SYSTEM") do
    set dev_mode: false
    set include_src: false
    set include_erts: System.get_env("ERL_LIB_DIR")
    set include_system_libs: System.get_env("ERL_SYSTEM_LIB_DIR")
    set vm_args: "rel/vm.args"
  end
end
```

To this:

```elixir
release :my_app do
  set version: current_version(:my_app)
  plugin Shoehorn
  plugin Nerves
end
```

**Update shoehorn**

You will need to update your version of shoehorn to `{:shoehorn, "~> 0.4"}`.

## v1.2.1

* Enhancements
  * Update minimum required version for fwup to at least 1.2.5

## v1.2.0

* Enhancements
  * Added ability to override provisioning.conf in the project mix config.
    This can be done by setting the key `provisioning`.

    Example:

      ```elixir
      config :nerves, :firmware,
        provisioning: "config/provisioning.conf"

      # or delegate it to an app that sets nerves_provisioning: "path/to/file"

      config :nerves, :firmware,
        provisioning: :nerves_hub
      ```
  * Bug Fixes
    * Fix issue with setting provisioning environment vairables when calling
      `mix firmware.burn` on Linux systems. Environment variables prefixed with
      `NERVES_` and the variable `SERIAL_NUMBER` will be copied into the environment.

## v1.1.1

* Enhancements
  * Updated docs to bump required versions of tools.

* Bug Fixes
  * Docker build runner
    * Use the version of the `nerves_system_br` as the tag for the docker image
      to pull by default.
    * Create and set the user id and group id in the docker entrypoint.
      This fixes issues with building buildroot packages that require
      access to the users home folder.

## v1.1.0

* Enhancements
  * `mix firmware.burn` can run within Windows Subsystem for Linux
  * Added `make_args` to `build_runner_opts`

  For example:

    You can configure the number of parallel jobs that buildroot
    can use for execution. This is useful for situations where you may
    have a machine with a lot of CPUs but not enough ram.

      # mix.exs
      defp nerves_package do
        [
          # ...
          build_runner_opts: [make_args: ["PARALLEL_JOBS=8"]],
        ]
      end

## v1.0.1

* Enhancements
  * General documentation updates.
* Bug fixes
  * Do not fetch artifacts on deps.get if they are overridden using environment
    variables like `NERVES_SYSTEM=/path/to/system`.

## v1.0.0

* Bug Fixes
  * `Nerves.Artifact.BuildRunners.Docker` was running as root and caused file
    permission issues with the `deps` directory of the root `mix` project.
    The `Docker` build runner now executes as the same user id and group id as
    the host.

## v1.0.0-rc.2

This version renames the module `Nerves.Artifact.Provider` to
`Nerves.Artifact.BuildRunner`. This change should only affect custom systems
and host tools that override the defaults in `nerves_package` config.

* Enhancements
  * Allow specifying multiple rootfs_overlay directories in the config.
  * Automatically remove corrupt files from the download directory.
  * Updated System documentation.
* Bug Fixes
  * Check the download directory before attempting to download the artifact.
  * Changed the host tool check to use `System.find_executable("command")` instead of
    calling out to `System.cmd("which", ["command"])`. This addressed an issue with
    NodeJS breaking anything that called into `which` resulting in an obscure error.

## v1.0.0-rc.1

This rc contains documentation cleanup and updates through out.

* Enhancements
  * Support forwarding the ssh-agent through Docker for the Nerves system shell.
  * Allow headers and query params to be passed to the `:prefix` `artifact_sites`
    helper.

    Example:
    `{:prefix, "https://my_server.com/", headers: [{"Authorization", "Basic 1234"}]}`
    `{:prefix, "https://my_server.com/", query_params: %{"id" => "1234"}}`

  * Added `github_api`to `artifact_sites` for accessing release artifacts on private
    github repositories.

    Example:
    `{:github_api, "owner/repo", username: "skroob", token: "1234567", tag: "v0.1.0"}`

* Bug Fixes
  * Disable the nerves_package compiler if the `NERVES_ENV_DISABLED` is set.
    This makes it easier to execute `mix` tasks without building the system.

    Example:
    `NERVES_ENV_DISABLED=1 mix docs`

## v1.0.0-rc.0

Nerves no longer automatically compiles any `nerves_package` that is missing its
pre-compiled artifact. This turned out to rarely be desired and caused
unexpectedly long compilation times when things like the Linux kernel or gcc got
compiled.

When a pre-compiled artifact is missing, Nerves will now tell you what your
options are to resolve this. It could be retrying `mix deps.get` to download it
again. If you want to force compilation to happen, add a `:nerves` option for
the desired package in your top level project:

```elixir
  {:nerves_system_rpi0, "~> 1.0-rc", nerves: [compile: true]}
```

* Bug Fixes
  * Mix raises a more informative error if the `nerves_package` compiler
    attempts to run and the `nerves_bootstrap` application has not been
    started.  This also produces more informative errors when trying to
    compile from the top of an umbrella.

## v0.11.0

* Bug Fixes
  * Including the entire artifact checksum in artifact download file name was causing issues with
    file encryption libraries. Fixed by changing the artifact download name to only
    use the first 7 of the artifact checksum.

## v0.10.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Ensure the artifact cache dir is clean and created before putting artifacts.

## v0.10.0

* Enhancements
  * Call `bootstrap/1` on any package that defines a platform
  * Added Nerves.Utils.File.tar helper for creating archives
  * Only apply the host tuple `portable` to packages with type `system`
  * Packages other then toolchains and systems can override their artifact
    paths using an env var of their app name. For example. a package called
    `:host_tool` would be able to override the artifact path by setting
    `HOST_TOOL` in the environment.
  * Allow any package that declares a provider to create an artifact.
  * Fixed up test fixtures and added integration test.

* Bug Fixes
  * Do not raise when trying to make a directory when putting an artifact in
    the global cache.
  * Ensure the Nerves environment has been started when calling `nerves
    artifact`

## v0.9.4

* Bug Fixes
  * Fix artifact archiver to use `Artifact.download_name/1` instead of
    `Artifact.name/1`. Fixes issues with the Docker provider and
    `mix nerves.artifact`
  * Fix issue with `nerves.system.shell` not rendering properly

## v0.9.3

* Bug Fixes
  * Artifact download_path should use download_name. This was causing a
    mismatch between dl files from buildroot and the resolver causing it to
    have to download them twice
  * Fixed issue with compiling certain nerves packages when calling
    `mix deps.compile`

## v0.9.2

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue where env var artifact path overides were being calculated
    instead of honored.

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue with artifact default path containing duplicate names
  * `Nerves.Env.host_os` can be set from `$HOST_OS` for use with canadian
    cross compile
  * `Nerves.Env.host_arch` can be set from `$HOST_ARCH` for use with canadian
    cross compile
  * mkdir -p on `Artifact.base_dir` before trying to link to build path
    artifacts
  * raise if artifact_urls are not binaries.

## v0.9.0

* Update Notes

Starting in Nerves v0.9.0, artifacts will no longer be fetched during `mix
compile`. Artifact archives are intended to be fetched following `mix deps.get`.
To handle this, you will need to update your installed version of
`nerves_bootstrap` by calling `mix nerves.local`. After updating
`nerves_bootstrap`, you should update your `mix.exs` file to add the new
required mix aliases found there. A helper function is available named
`Nerves.Bootstrap.add_aliases` that you can pipe your existing aliases to like
this:

```elixir
  defp aliases(_target) do
    [
      # Add custom mix aliases here
    ]
    |> Nerves.Bootstrap.add_aliases()
  end
```

Also, update your nerves dependency to:

`{:nerves, "~> 0.9", runtime: false}`

* API Changes
  * Moved `Nerves.Package.Providers` to `Nerves.Artifact.Providers`
  * Moved `Nerves.Package.Providers.HTTP` to `Nerves.Artifact.Resolver`
  * `Nerves.Artifact.Resolver` no longer implements the
    `Nerves.Artifact.Provider` behaviour.

* Enhancements
  * Added Mix task `nerves.artifact.get`. Use to fetch the artifact archive from an
    `artifact_url` location. Once downloaded its checksum will be checked against
    `artifact_checksum` from the `nerves_package` config in `mix.exs`. The Mix task
    `nerves.deps.get` will recursively call `nerves.artifact.get` to fetch archives.
  * Added Mix task `nerves.artifact`. This task will produce the
    artifact archive file which are used when calling `nerves.artifact.get`.
  * Nerves packages can override the Provider in the `nerves_package` config
    in `mix.exs` using the keys `provider` and `provider_opts`. This is
    useful to force a package to build using a specific provider like
    `Nerves.Artifact.Providers.Docker`. See the [package configuration docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/systems.html#package-configuration)
    for more information.
  * Added `artifact_sites` to the `nerves_package` config. Artifact sites
    are helpers that are useful for cleanly specifying locations where artifacts
    can be fetched. If you are hosting your artifacts using Github releases
    you can specify it like this:
    ```elixir
    artifact_sites: [
      {:github_releases, "organization/project"}
    ]
    ```

    You can also specify your own custom server location by using the `:prefix`
    helper by passing a url or file path:
    ```elixir
    artifact_sites: [
      {:prefix, "/path/to/artifacts"}
      {:prefix, "https://my_bucket.s3-east.amazonaws.com/artifacts"}
    ]
    ```
    Artifact sites will be tried in order until one successfully downloads the
    artifact.
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue with `Nerves.Utils.HTTPResolver` crashing when missing the
    `content-disposition` and `content-length` headers.
  * Run integrity check on tar files to validate they are not corrupted on
    download.

## v0.8.3

* Bug Fixes
  * Revert plugin Nerves in new project generator until
    the fix can be made in distillery.
    This issue was causing the release to contain compiled
    libraries from the host instead of the target.
    The error would look similar to this
    ```text
    Got:
    ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1

    If binary, expecting:
    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.3, for GNU/Linux 4.1.39
    ```
    You can fix this by updating and regenerating the new project.

## v0.8.2

* Enhancements
  * Added [contributing guide](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  * Improved error messages when `NERVES_SYSTEM` or `NERVES_TOOLCHAIN` are unset.

* Bug Fixes
  * Don't override the output_dir in the Distillery Plugin.

## v0.8.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed an error in the `Nerves` Distillery plugin that was causing the following error message:
    ```text
    Plugin failed: no function clause matching in IO.chardata_to_string/1
    ```

## v0.8.0

* Enhancements
  * Removed legacy compiler key from the package struct. The `nerves_package` compiler will be chosen by default.
  * Simplified the distillery release config by making Nerves a distillery plugin
  * Skip archival phase when making firmware.
  * Allow the progress bar to be disabled for use in CI systems by setting `NERVES_LOG_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BAR=1`
  * Deprecate nerves.exs. The contents of nerves.exs files have been moved into mix.exs under the project key `nerves_package`

* Bug Fixes
  * raise an exception when the artifact build encounters an error

## v0.7.5

* Enhancements
  * Docker
    * Reduced the image size by optimizing docker file.
    * Images are pulled from Docker Hub instead of building locally.
    * Containers are transient and build files are stored in docker volumes.
    * NERVES_BR_DL_DIR is mounted as a host volume instead of a docker volume.

* Bug Fixes
  * Docker
    * Fixed issue where moving the project location on the host would require
      the container to be force deleted.

## v0.7.4

* Bug Fixes
  * Make sure the path NERVES_DL_DIR exists before writing artifacts to it.

## v0.7.3

* Enhancements
  * [mix firmware.image] remove the need to pass an image name. Default to the app name.
  * [mix] added shortdocs to all mix tasks.
  * [fwup] bumped requirement to ~> 0.15 and support 1.0.0 pre release.
  * Cache downloads to ~/.nerves/dl or $NERVES_DL_DIR if defined.

## v0.7.2

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue where `nerves.system.shell` would hang and load improperly.
* Enhancements
  * Deprecated the `rootfs_additions` configuration option, to be superseded by
    the `rootfs_overlay` option, which matches the convention used by the
    Buildroot community.

## v0.7.1

* Bug Fixes
  * The `nerves.system.shell` Mix task should not do `make clean` by default.
* Enhancements
  * The "Customizing Your Own Nerves System" documentation has been updated to
    include the `mix nerves.system.shell` functionality, including a blurb to
    recommend running a clean build any time it's not working as expected.

## 0.7.0

* Bug Fixes
  * Try to include the parent project when loading Nerves packages
  * Better error message from the Docker provider when Docker is not installed
  * Delete system artifact directories only when instructed by `mix nerves.clean` on Linux.
    This prevents triggering a full rebuild for every change made to a custom system.
* Enhancements
  * Added support for the new `nerves.system.shell` task, provided by
    `nerves_bootstrap`, to `Nerves.Package.Providers.Docker` and
    `Nerves.Package.Providers.Local`, which provides a consistent way to
    configure a Buildroot-based Nerves system on both OSX and Linux. This
    replaces the `nerves.shell` Mix task, which had not been fully implemented.
  * `mix firmware.burn` no longer asks for your password if using Linux and have
     read/write permissions on the SD card device.
