# Code review process

* Each repository should have an owner and one or more maintainers.
* At least one approval is required to merge a Pull Request.
* Anyone on the core team can approve a Pull Request on any repository.

  > NOTE: Please approve responsibly. If you're not deeply familiar with the code, feel free to comment or request changes, but don't approve.

* The owner of a repository should be the one to perform the merge.

  > NOTE: We prefer the GitHub "Rebase and Merge" button, but any method is OK.

* If the owner can't or doesn't merge an approved Pull Request within a
  reasonable amount of time, one of the maintainers can do so.

  > NOTE: The definition of "reasonable" here depends on the urgency of the  change. Be respectful of the repository owner as well as the needs of the  community. If you're planning to merge a Pull Request on behalf of the owner,  be sure to communicate your intention with the core team as much as possible  ahead of time.
