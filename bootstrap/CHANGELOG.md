# nerves_bootstrap

## v0.6.2
* Enhancements
  * Change the new project generator to use the new `rootfs_overlay` option
    rather than the deprecated `rootfs_additions` option and also recommend
    placing the relevant files in a top-level `rootfs_overlay` directory in the
    project root rather than in `config/rootfs_additions`.
## v0.6.1
* Enhancements
  * Improved error messages in `nerves.system.shell` Mix task. In particular,
    it now reminds you to set `MIX_TARGET`.
* Bug Fixes
  * The `nerves.env` Mix task (used internally by Nerves) now checks that your
    deps have been fetched before trying to load.
  * Fix extraneous whitespace in `mix.exs` generated by `mix nerves.new`

## v0.6.0
* Enhancements
  * New `nerves.system.shell` Mix task, which provides a consistent way to
    configure a Buildroot-based Nerves system on both OSX and Linux. This
    replaces the `nerves.shell` Mix task that was provided by the `nerves`
    dependency, which had not been fully implemented.
  * Add an optional `--disabled` flag to the `nerves.env` Mix task, which allows
    the Nerves environment to be compiled and loaded in a disabled state so that
    it doesn't try to actually cross-compile all the dependencies at load time.
    This is primarily used so that Mix tasks like `nerves.system.shell` can run
    on the host without having to wait for dependencies to compile when they
    won't even be used.
  * Related to the previous change, the `nerves.precompile` task does not try to
    compile the toolchain and system when `Nerves.Env` is loaded in a disabled
    state.

## v0.4.0
* Enhancements
  * nerves.new
    * lock files are split by target
    * Target dependencies are explicitly broken out in mix.exs through passing
      `--target` to the generator. Defaults to declaring all officially supported
      Nerves Targets.
    * A default cookie is generated and placed in the vm.args. the cookie can
      be set by passing `--cookie`
