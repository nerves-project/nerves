# Installation

The following is a collection of tools and dependencies required for your system to run Nerves properly. If you are experiencing issues with any of the tooling, it is important to reference this list to ensure that your system is fully configured to run the Nerves tooling.

## Elixir

Nerves applications are written using Elixir and requires version `>= 1.2.4`. If you need help installing Elixir, please reference the Elixir [Installation Page](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

In addition to Elixir, you will need to fetch dependencies and often compile some Erlang code. Once Elixir is installed you can issue the following commands to install the latest version of both Hex and Rebar

```
$ mix local.hex
$ mix local.rebar
```

## Erlang

Elixir runs on top of the Erlang VM on your host as well as on your target board. What makes Nerves special is that we replace typical linux initialization mechanisms like systemd or udev with Erlang. This puts your application in a unique and powerful position of having control over the subsystem initialization as well as your application runtime.

If you followed the instructions from earlier to install Elixir using the instructions found on the Elixir [Installation Page](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html), you should already have Erlang installed.

If you need to install Erlang, it is often best to install using guides and repositories provided by [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html)

## fwup

The fwup utility is a configurable image-based firmware update utility for embedded Linux-based systems. It has two modes of operation. The first mode creates compressed archives containing root file system images, bootloaders, and other image material. These can be distributed via websites, email or update servers. The second mode applies the firmware images in a robust and repeatable way.

Nerves uses fwup to create and distribute firmware bundles. You can install fwup using the instructions found on the [Installation Page](https://github.com/fhunleth/fwup#installing)

## Host Specific tools

When finalizing firmware and creating a root filesystem for your target, Nerves utilizes scripts and utilities which have dependencies on the following tools.

`gstat`
`squashfs-tools`

For MacOS, these tools can be installed using Homebrew. For more information on how to install homebrew, visit the homebrew [Installation Page](http://brew.sh/)

Once homebrew is installed, you can install these missing utilities by running the following
```
$ brew install coreutils squashfs
```

For Debian-based Linux systems, you can install these utilities by running:
```
sudo apt-get install coreutils squashfs-tools
```

## Nerves Bootstrap

With Elixir, Erlang, and your host utilities installed, you can now add the `nerves_bootstrap` archive to your Mix environment. This archive allows Nerves to bootstrap the Mix environment (i.e. fetch the System and Toolchain for your target), ensuring that your code is properly compiled using the right cross-compiler for the target. The `nerves_bootstrap` archive also includes a new project generator, which you can use to create new Nerves projects. To install the `nerves_bootstrap` archive:

```
$ mix archive.install https://github.com/nerves-project/archives/raw/master/nerves_bootstrap.ez
```

If the archive fails to install properly using this command, you can download the archive directly and then do:

```
$ mix archive.install /path/to/nerves_bootstrap.ez
```
