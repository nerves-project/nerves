# Internals

The nerves bootstrapping process has several steps.  Its goal is to locate 
the "system", compile it, and use the compiled system to setup the cross 
compile environment.

## Call Tree

Below is a brief sketch of the call tree for the boostrap.  It is intended
to be a "10,000 ft" overview.

### mix firmware
* alias
  * nerves.precompile
    * NERVES_PRECOMPILE = 1
    * Mix.Tasks.Nerves.Env

          * nerves_env.exs Nerves.System.BR

### nerves_package
  * Nerves.Env.start
  * Nerves.Env.enabled? and Nerves.Artifact.stale?(package)
    * Nerves.Package.artifact(package, toolchain)
      * pkg.provider.artifact(pkg, toolchain, opts) [Nerves.Artifact.Providers.HTTP, Nerves.Artifact.Providers.Local]
* firmware

# Key Files/Variables

The following are the key parts of the bootstrap.  Note that NERVES_SYSTEM and 
NERVES_TOOLCHAIN can be defined before running `mix firmware` to point to a 
trusted decompressed system or toolchain. This is useful in situations where 
you produce a system directly using Buildroot and want to force Nerves to use it.

NERVES_SYSTEM 
  * Path to the nerves_system_* folder
  * Has to be defined at Nerves.Env.bootstrap() or system blows up
  * Exists only if the system dependency is being included from a source other than hex.
    * When a system is being sourced from hex, it will attempt to place the uncompressed artifact in the global path located at ~/.nerves/artifacts or $NERVES_ARTIFACTS_DIR

NERVES_TOOLCHAIN 
  * Path to the toolchain
  * Has to defined at Nerves.Env.bootstrap() or systems blows up

nerves_env.exs
  * Sets the cross compile flags
  * NERVES_SYSTEM and NERVES_TOOLCHAIN must be defined prior
  * Everything thing run after will try to cross compile

nerves_system/.nerves/artifacts/nerves_system_*
   * "package" directory
   * Gets fetched from nerves_env.exs artifact_url
