# Targets

Nerves provides support for a set of common targets. Each target is referenced with a unique tag name. These tags are used when instructing Nerves which target you would like to compile for. It is important to note that a single tag name may offer support for more than one target board.

## Supported Targets and Systems

Target | System | Tag

Raspberry Pi 2 | [nerves_system_rpi2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi2) | rpi2
Raspberry Pi 3 | [nerves_system_rpi3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi3) | rpi3
BeagleBone Black | [nerves_system_bbb](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_bbb) | bbb
Alix | [nerves_system_alix](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_alix) | alix
AG150 | [nerves_system_ag150](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_ag150) | ag150
Intel Galileo 2 | [nerves_system_galileo](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_galileo) | galileo
Lego EV3 | [nerves_system_ev3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_ev3) | ev3

## Changing Targets

Nerves projects are configured to allow you to switch between targets by changing the value for the environment variable `NERVES_TARGET`. We configure our project to include the correct system for the target you choose by interpolating it into a string atom for the system reference.

```
def system(target) do
  [{:"nerves_system_#{target}", ">= 0.0.0"}]
end
```

Targets can be set and persisted several ways.

**Global Level** In your shell, you can `export NERVES_TARGET=rpi3`. This is useful if you only own a certain board and want to checkout and play with a variety of published nerves projects.

**Project Level** At the top of the mix file for a Nerves project, you can specify a default target tag:
```
@target System.get_env("NERVES_TARGET") || "rpi3"
```

**Run Level** You can switch targets at the issue of every mix command by specifying, for example, `NERVES_TARGET=rpi3 mix compile`

A Run Level setting will override a Project Level setting, which will override a Global Level setting.

## Target Dependencies

It is important to note that, although Nerves supports multiple targets for a single application codebase, only one `nerves_system` can be included in a given firmware. Because of this, we recommend taking the following approach for including the system dependency separately from your application dependencies.

First, tell the project configuration to concatenate the global application dependencies with the system dependencies:

```
def project do
  [app: :hello_nerves,
   version: "0.0.1",
   target: @target,
   archives: [nerves_bootstrap: "0.1.2"],
   deps_path: "deps/#{@target}",
   build_path: "_build/#{@target}",
   build_embedded: Mix.env == :prod,
   start_permanent: Mix.env == :prod,
   aliases: aliases,
   deps: deps ++ system(@target)]
end
```

This allows you to keep the `nerves_system` separate form the rest of your dependencies:

```
def deps do
  [{:nerves, "~> 0.3.0"}]
end

def system(target) do
  [{:"nerves_system_#{target}", ">= 0.0.0"}]
end
```
